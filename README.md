- Looping through arrays
- Multi-dimensional arrays
- Basic array operations

---

### 🗓 Day 5: Strings
- String basics and object creation
- Comparing strings
- Useful methods: `length()`, `charAt()`, `substring()`, etc.
- String immutability

---

### 🗓 Day 6: Functions and Methods
- Creating and calling methods
